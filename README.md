# use deg.py to remove the degeneracy from the hr.dat file

# use the modified realspace hamiltonian in the ham.py code to create layer wise Hamiltonian.

# use each layer Hamiltonian in the mathematica code or the matlab code to fourier transform it into two other directions.

# now you have some .csv files that has information of each layers in momentum space.
