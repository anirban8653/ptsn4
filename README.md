# use deg.py to remove the degeneracy from the hr.dat file
# use the modified realspace hamiltonian in the ham.py code to create layer wise Hamiltonian.
# use each layer Hamiltonian in the mathematica code or the matlab code to fourier transform it into two other directions.
# now you have some .csv files that has information of each layers in momentum space.
# use these .csv files into the mathematica code eig_bulk.m to calculate the spectral weight for the bulk
# or use the .csv files to calculate the spectral weight for the surface by modifying the eig_bulk.m file just by removing the boundary conditions.
